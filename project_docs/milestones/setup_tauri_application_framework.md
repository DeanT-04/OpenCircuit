# ✅ Task Completed: Setup Tauri Application Framework

## 📂 Files Touched
- src-tauri/Cargo.toml (created)
- src-tauri/tauri.conf.json (created)
- src-tauri/src/main.rs (created)
- src-tauri/src/lib.rs (created)
- src-tauri/build.rs (created)
- src-tauri/capabilities/default.json (created)
- src-tauri/icons/* (created)
- src/lib.rs (modified - added initialize function)
- Cargo.toml (modified - uncommented tauri dependency, added src-tauri to workspace)
- dist/index.html (created - basic frontend placeholder)

## ⚙️ Commands Run

```sh
cargo install tauri-cli
cargo tauri init
cargo tauri build --debug
.\target\debug\opencircuit-tauri.exe
```

## 🧪 Tests Passed

* [x] Tauri CLI installed successfully
* [x] Tauri project initialized with proper configuration
* [x] Application builds without errors
* [x] Executable launches successfully
* [x] Basic window opens with placeholder frontend
* [x] Rust-JavaScript bridge functions defined (greet, get_app_version, initialize_opencircuit)

## 🧠 Notes

* Fixed workspace configuration by adding src-tauri to workspace.members
* Corrected bundle identifier from com.opencircuit.app to com.opencircuit.desktop
* Updated Tauri features from shell-open to macos-private-api for compatibility
* Removed problematic log plugin configuration that was causing startup errors
* Created basic HTML frontend as placeholder for future development
* Integrated main OpenCircuit library with Tauri commands
* Application successfully starts and shows "OpenCircuit Tauri application starting..." log

## 🎯 Deliverables

* ✅ Tauri application framework fully set up
* ✅ Cross-platform desktop application foundation ready
* ✅ Basic window configuration (800x600, centered, themed)
* ✅ Rust-JavaScript bridge established
* ✅ Build system configured for debug and release modes
* ✅ MSI and NSIS installers generated for Windows distribution

## 🔄 Next Steps

The Tauri application framework is now ready for:
- Frontend development (React/Astro integration)
- Advanced UI components
- Circuit simulation integration
- File system operations
- Native system integrations
