# ✅ Task Completed: Cargo Project Initialization

## 📂 Files Created
- `Cargo.toml` - Main project configuration with dependencies and workspace setup
- `src/lib.rs` - Core library structure with modules, configuration, and error handling
- `src/main.rs` - Application entry point with initialization and basic functionality tests
- `src/ai/mod.rs` - AI integration module stub (placeholder for Phase 2)
- `src/circuit/mod.rs` - Circuit simulation module stub with basic component structures
- `src/database/mod.rs` - Database module stub (placeholder for Phase 2)
- `src/gui/mod.rs` - GUI module stub with application state structures
- `src/pcb/mod.rs` - PCB layout and routing module stub with design structures
- `src/utils/mod.rs` - Common utilities, constants, and helper functions

## ⚙️ Commands Run

```sh
cargo check
cargo run
cargo test
```

## 🧪 Tests Passed

* [x] Project compiles successfully with `cargo check`
* [x] Application runs and displays welcome message
* [x] All 18 unit tests pass (17 lib tests + 1 main test)
* [x] Configuration loading works correctly
* [x] Logging system initializes properly
* [x] Data directory creation works
* [x] All module stubs are properly structured

## 🔧 Dependencies Configured

### Core Dependencies
- `anyhow` - Error handling
- `thiserror` - Custom error types
- `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` - Logging
- `serde` + `serde_json` - Serialization
- `tokio` - Async runtime (for future use)
- `chrono` - Date/time handling
- `config` - Configuration management
- `dirs` - Directory utilities
- `uuid` - Unique identifiers

### Development Dependencies
- `criterion` - Benchmarking
- `proptest` - Property-based testing
- `tempfile` - Temporary files for tests
- `tokio-test` - Async testing utilities

## 🧠 Notes

* Used simplified foundational setup without optional dependencies
* Removed complex feature flags to focus on core functionality
* All modules are properly structured as stubs for future implementation
* Configuration system supports environment variables and file-based config
* Error handling system is comprehensive and extensible
* Logging system is properly initialized with tracing
* Data directory is automatically created in user's AppData/Roaming
* All tests pass, confirming the foundation is solid

## 🎯 Next Steps

The foundation is now ready for the next task: **Tauri Application Framework Setup** (Task 1.2), which will add the desktop application framework and GUI capabilities.

## ✅ Task Status

**COMPLETED** - Cargo project initialization is fully functional and tested.
