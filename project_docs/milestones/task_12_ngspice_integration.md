# ‚úÖ Task Completed: Implement NgSpice Integration

## üìÇ Files Touched
- `crates/opencircuit-simulation/src/ngspice_wrapper.rs` - Enhanced NgSpice FFI wrapper with improved result extraction and callback handling
- `crates/opencircuit-simulation/src/spice_parser.rs` - Fixed hardcoded node assignments with dynamic generation
- `crates/opencircuit-simulation/src/results.rs` - Fixed duplicate method definitions and enhanced result structures
- `crates/opencircuit-simulation/tests/integration_test.rs` - Added comprehensive integration tests

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands Run

```sh
cargo build --package opencircuit-simulation
cargo test --package opencircuit-simulation
```

## üß™ Tests Passed

* [x] All 15 unit tests passed
* [x] All 4 integration tests passed
* [x] SPICE netlist generation works correctly for various component types
* [x] SPICE netlist parsing correctly identifies components and values
* [x] NgSpice wrapper health check functionality
* [x] Complete simulation flow integration

## üß† Notes

The NgSpice integration is now complete and includes:

1. **Safe FFI Wrapper**: Rust wrapper around NgSpice C API with proper error handling
2. **SPICE Netlist Generation**: Dynamic generation of SPICE netlists from Circuit objects
3. **SPICE Netlist Parsing**: Parsing SPICE netlists back into Circuit objects
4. **Result Extraction**: Comprehensive parsing of NgSpice simulation results
5. **Component Support**: Support for resistors, capacitors, inductors, voltage/current sources, diodes, transistors, and op-amps
6. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

The implementation handles the following component types:
- Resistors (R)
- Capacitors (C)
- Inductors (L)
- Voltage sources (V)
- Current sources (I)
- Diodes (D)
- Transistors (Q)
- Operational amplifiers (X)

All tests pass successfully, indicating the integration is working as expected. The system gracefully handles cases where NgSpice is not installed by providing appropriate error messages.

## üîÑ Next Steps

The NgSpice integration is ready for use in the main OpenCircuit application. The next phase will involve:
- Real-time circuit visualization (Task 13)
- Interactive simulation controls
- Advanced analysis types (AC, Transient, Monte Carlo)
