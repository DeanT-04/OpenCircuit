# ✅ Task Completed: Setup Database Schema and Connections

## 📂 Files Touched
- Cargo.toml (added database dependencies)
- src/database/mod.rs (implemented database module)
- src/database/schema.rs (implemented schema and migrations)
- migrations/001_initial.sql (created initial migration file)

## ⚙️ Commands Run

```sh
cargo add rusqlite --features bundled
cargo add tempfile --dev
cargo test database --lib
```

## 🧪 Tests Passed

* [x] Database initialization works correctly
* [x] Schema migrations are idempotent
* [x] Component CRUD operations function properly
* [x] Component search functionality works
* [x] Component filtering works
* [x] Category retrieval works
* [x] All 6 database tests pass

## 🧠 Notes

* Switched from `sqlx` to `rusqlite` due to Cargo edition compatibility issues
* Used simplified string-based IDs instead of UUIDs for better compatibility
* Implemented thread-safe database access using `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>`
* Created comprehensive test suite covering all database operations
* Database file is stored in user's data directory under "OpenCircuit/components.db"
* Schema includes tables for components, component categories, and component vectors (for future AI features)
* Pre-populated with 12 default component categories

## 📋 Database Schema

### Tables Created:
1. **components** - Main component storage with part numbers, manufacturers, categories, etc.
2. **component_categories** - Predefined categories like "Resistors", "Capacitors", etc.
3. **component_vectors** - For future AI embedding storage
4. **migrations** - Tracks applied database migrations

### Key Features:
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexes on commonly queried fields (part_number, manufacturer, category)
- Automatic timestamp management
- JSON specifications storage for flexible component data
- Support for component search and filtering

## 🔄 Task Status
✅ Database schema implemented and tested
✅ Connection management working
✅ CRUD operations functional
✅ Migration system in place
✅ All tests passing
