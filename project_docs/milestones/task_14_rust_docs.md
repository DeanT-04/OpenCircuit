## üß† Notes

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **egui-based Rendering**: Chose `egui` for immediate mode GUI due to its simplicity and integration with existing codebase
2. **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into distinct modules (primitives, styles, animations, viewer)
3. **Theme System**: Implemented configurable themes for accessibility and user preference
4. **Animation Framework**: Created flexible animation system for real-time simulation visualization

### Technical Details:
- Uses `tokio` for async simulation updates
- Implements proper error handling with `thiserror`
- Provides both high-level and low-level APIs
- Includes comprehensive test coverage
- Follows Rust best practices for API design

### Integration Points:
- Ready to integrate with `opencircuit-core` for circuit data
- Compatible with `opencircuit-simulation` for real-time updates
- Designed to work with existing GUI infrastructure
- Provides clear interfaces for future extensions

### Future Enhancements:
- Add more component types (transistors, diodes, ICs)
- Implement SPICE netlist import/export
- Add measurement tools and probes
- Support for PCB layout visualization
- Advanced animation effects for complex simulations

The implementation successfully addresses the "Implement Real-time Circuit Visualization" task by providing a complete, production-ready graphics system for circuit schematics with real-time simulation support.
