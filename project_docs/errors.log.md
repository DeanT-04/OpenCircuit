# 🐛 OpenCircuit Error Log

## 📝 Error Tracking Guidelines

This file tracks debugging efforts and persistent issues encountered during OpenCircuit development. Errors are logged **only after 5+ retry attempts** fail to resolve an issue.

### 🔍 Log Format
Each error entry includes:
- **Task Context**: Which task was being worked on
- **Error Summary**: Brief description of the issue
- **Attempts Made**: List of debugging steps tried
- **Current Status**: Whether resolved, workaround found, or still open
- **Next Steps**: Planned approach for resolution

## 🔧 Common Debugging Strategies

### Rust Compilation Issues
1. Check `cargo check` for detailed error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are compatible versions
3. Clear build cache with `cargo clean`
4. Update Rust toolchain with `rustup update`
5. Check for conflicting feature flags

### Tauri Integration Issues
1. Verify WebView2 runtime is installed
2. Check Tauri configuration in `tauri.conf.json`
3. Ensure Node.js dependencies are installed
4. Test with `cargo tauri dev` vs `cargo tauri build`
5. Check platform-specific requirements

### NgSpice Integration Issues
1. Verify NgSpice installation and PATH configuration
2. Check library linking and FFI bindings
3. Test with simple SPICE netlist first
4. Verify memory management in unsafe code
5. Check platform-specific library names

### AI API Integration Issues
1. Verify API keys are correctly configured
2. Check network connectivity and firewall settings
3. Test with minimal API requests first
4. Verify rate limiting compliance
5. Check API response format changes

### Database Issues
1. Verify SQLite installation and permissions
2. Check database file creation and access
3. Test with simple queries first
4. Verify migration scripts are correct
5. Check for file locking issues

### Performance Issues
1. Profile with `cargo flamegraph` or similar tools
2. Check for memory leaks with valgrind
3. Verify async operations are not blocking
4. Test with smaller datasets first
5. Check for unnecessary allocations
